Here is the Readme of the folder Projet7_DDesoubzdanne.
I am Denis Desoubzdanne-Dumont, student at OpenClassRooms in the Data Scientist programm.
All information needed are stored in this Readme!

/!\ The dataset to download is the following : https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/static.oc-static.com/prod/courses/files/Parcours_data_scientist/Projet+-+Impl%C3%A9menter+un+mod%C3%A8le+de+scoring/Projet+Mise+en+prod+-+home-credit-default-risk.zip

The zip file must be stored in the same folder than the notebook used to generate the model (ie "dossier_code_112023")

The notebook was developped from the notebooks generated by Will Koehrsen : https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/code
(thanks dude!!)
